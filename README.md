# AoC2018
penwing's Advent of Code 2018 Repo

This is a repository for my code for Advent of Code 2018. Details for this challenge are at http://www.adventofcode.com/2018
Each day has a puzzle with two parts. I try to put each part DayXX/Puzzle X.hs. 

I have been using Haskell so far. This year, I'm trying to be better with using IO functions and getting Haskell to process the input I'm given (unlike last year where I processed most inputs into Haskell lists manually)

I am [@penwing](https://www.twitter.com/penwing) on Twitter and [@penwing@cybre.space](https://cybre.space//@penwing) on Mastodon Federations
I am @penwing:cybre.space on Matrix
I am aoc@penwing.me.uk for queries relating to AoC
