# AoC2018 Day 2 - Inventory Management System

## Part 1
Part 1 asked us to find _similar_ inventory IDs. This part though wanted us to generate a _checksum_ for the input list - in particular it wanted a _checksum_ made up of the number of strings with two matching characters multipled by the number of strings with three matching characters

## Part 2
Part 2 asked us to find the two _similar_ strings and provide just the common characters. _Similar_ here meant differed by one character.
