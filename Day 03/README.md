# AoC2018 Day 3 - No matter how you slice it

## Part 1
Part 1 asked us to find how many quare inches of fabric were claimed by two or more overlapping ideas for cutting. I initially planned on literally mapping the claims onto an `[[[Int]]]` representing a list of all IDs claiming that square of the cloth. Then ~I decided _screw that_ and instead just kept a list of the relevent co-ordinates. I went through multiple iterations trying to avoid traversing the list of co-ordinates too many times (hence the `makeClaim1` series of functions having 1 appended to their names).
